# Global-Debt
The Global Debt Database (GDD) is the outcome of an extensive investigative process 
initiated with the October 2016 Fiscal Monitor. This dataset encapsulates the total gross 
debt of the nonfinancial sector (both private and public) for an unbalanced panel of 
190 advanced economies, emerging market economies, and low-income countries, with 
records dating back to 1950. The Global Debt Dataset aggregates information from  diverse sources to offer a comprehensive view of both public and private debt metrics.  It includes data on government debt, corporate debt, household debt, and external debt,  enabling users to delve into trends, patterns, and interrelationships among different  debt categories.

Content 
The dataset furnishes crucial information for comprehending global debt trends. Key 
columns encompass the country name, inflation indicator type, and annual average debt 
percentages from 1950 to 2022. This dataset empowers researchers and policymakers 
for thorough analyses, allowing exploration of relationships between country-specific 
indicators and debt percentages. Through meticulous examination, users can unveil 
patterns in the financial landscapes of diverse economies over the past seven decades. 
This historical record stands as a valuable tool, providing insights into the complexities 
of global economic dynamics.
